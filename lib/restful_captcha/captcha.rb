    # appear. The options that are accepted are:
    # * +text+ - the text displayed in the captcha image; will be randomly generated if not specified
    # * +width+, +height+ - dimensions of the image in pixels; defaults to 200x100
    # * +color+, +background_color+ - accpeted color values are described at http://www.imagemagick.org/RMagick/doc/imusage.html#color_names
    # * +background+ - used to specify a background texture instead of a solid color; overrides background color if specified; accepted values are described at http://www.imagemagick.org/RMagick/doc/imusage.html#builtin_formats
    # * +font+, +font_family+, +font_style+, +font_weight+, +font_size+ - font properties; see http://www.imagemagick.org/RMagick/doc/draw.html#font for info
    # * +secret+ - a string to be hidden in the captcha. It will be returned to the client in the event a correct answer is submitted.
